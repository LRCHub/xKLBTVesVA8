[00:05.11] Come a little closer baby
[00:21.49] I feel like layin' you down
[00:25.33] On a bed of sweet surrender
[00:33.92] Where we can work it all out
[00:47.92] 
[00:37.97] There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
[00:47.32] Girl, it's right here at our fingertips
[00:52.93] So come a little closer baby
[00:57.34] I feel like layin' you down
[01:10.84] 
[01:01.53] Come a little closer baby
[01:09.29] I feel like lettin' go
[01:13.09] Of everything that stands between us
[01:22.69] And the love we used to know
[01:36.69] 
[01:25.56] I wanna touch you like a cleansin' rain
[01:36.66] And let it wash all the hurt away
[01:40.83] So come a little closer baby
[01:45.54] I feel like lettin' go
[01:56.54] 
[01:48.84] If there's still a chance then take my hand
[02:00.12] And we'll steal away
[02:01.67] Off into the night, until we make things right
[02:11.88] The sun's gonna rise, on a better day
[02:30.38] 
[02:16.80] Come a little closer baby
[02:45.54] I feel like strippin' it down
[02:48.80] Back to the basics of you and me
[02:58.87] And what makes the world go 'round
[03:15.87] 
[03:03.06] Every inch of you against my skin
[03:11.67] I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
[03:17.97] So come a little closer baby
[03:21.83] I feel like strippin' it down
[03:36.33] 
[03:25.00] Come a little closer baby
[03:33.13] Just a little bit closer baby
[03:39.60] Come a little closer baby
[03:45.72] I feel like layin' you down
